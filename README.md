## Description

This ReactJS-based Car Search Website is designed for desktop screens, providing users with the ability to search for cars, paginate through listings, and view car details. The website is built with a focus on functionality and adheres to the specified task requirements.

## Task

The following tasks were successfully completed:
- Implemented car search functionality based on car names.
- Paginated car listings with a display of 6 cars per page.
- Styled car cards to match the provided design, maintaining visual similarity.
- Integrated routing with page URLs that change according to pagination (e.g., `/page/1`, `/page/2`, etc.).
- Created a fully functional pagination component with next, previous, and page number buttons.
- Limited pagination to display only 10 pages, hardcoded for consistency.

## Guidelines

- This project was developed using ReactJS for the frontend.
- CSS frameworks like Bootstrap and Tailwind were not used, and custom styles were applied.
- Global state management was not utilized, as it was not required for this project.
- The project uses mock data from a JSON file, with no API integration.
- Proper code structuring and component composition were followed.
- Best practices in ReactJS development were applied, ensuring a functional and organized codebase.
- The codebase is version-controlled and committed to a repository.
